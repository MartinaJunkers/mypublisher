  <h2>Recipe</h2>

  My daughter is six and last October, just before Halloween we went for a walk in one of our favourite parks – Deerpark Forest in Virginia. They are famous for their Virginia Pumpkin Festival and just before Halloween they organize a Haunted Forest Walk which is just fantastic, with actors dressed as spirits and zombies and vampires, spooking children walking through the forest with their parents in an almost complete darkness.

As probably most children, my daughter isn’t happy with enjoying the silence and the beauty of the forest. So inspired by the poster promoting the forest walk she wanted to hear a “spooky story”. I saw a tree stump and a river and all of a sudden, a story started telling itself. She wanted more and more and by the end of the walk the whole forest was inhabited by spirits, fairies and other strange creatures.
