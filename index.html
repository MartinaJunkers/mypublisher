  <h2>Recipe</h2>

  I divided my stories into categories as not all of them are scary. There aren’t many though as my child seems to take special pleasure at listening to a spooky story and then being scared of going upstairs on her own for the next hour. Reminds me of myself when I was a child, I think it’s a part of being young and still have the imagination of an innocent little person.
