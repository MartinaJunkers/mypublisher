  <h2>Recipe</h2>

  Most of my cooking is pretty uncomplicated. I love doing things from scratch but most of the time I’m under time pressure hence the prep has to be quick. Sometimes, however, I go for the fiddly stuff, especially when I want to make my daughter and husband happy.

We are a pasta family, mainly because despite living in Ireland our daughter doesn’t like potatoes. We belong to the rare families who go to a restaurant, are presented with the usual boring chicken goujons + chips or burger + chips Kid’s Menu and ask for pasta.

So this Sunday I went for a bit time-consuming and more prep requiring option: ravioli in beef broth.

The beef broth is fairly simple. I love slow cooking as it’s a great way of transforming a cheap cut of meat into a falling-off-the-bone delicacy and so I took out my trusty Le Creuset pot (I’m working on getting a slow cooker but we need to create more space in the kitchen first) and started cracking.

Ingredients for beef broth:

900g brisket

carrots and parsnips (I had 3 smaller carrots and parsnips)

one large onion

bay leaves, thyme, juniper berries, salt and pepper

 

Wash the carrots and parsnips (no need to peel them unless they are very dirty), cut them to bigger chunks, peel the onion skin and put the whole lot into a large pot with the meat and spices. Cover with water and cook on low heat for about 5 hours.

After the broth is done, strain it through a sieve, discard the veggies and spices and cut the meat into smaller chunks.

Now it’s time for your ravioli. There are so many different options for your filling, as long as it’s not too runny, it’s fine. We love the sweet version of ravioli too, filled with firmer jam and then served with melted butter and milled walnuts or poppy seeds and sugar. Or even chocolate sauce, for that matter.

Originally I wanted to do spinach and ricotta filling but after a bit of a rushed shopping on Saturday I realized I didn’t buy ricotta cheese. However, I had a nice sweet potato and a chunk of smoked cheddar in my fridge so off they went into the filling.

Ingredients:

1 smaller sweet potato

450g of fresh spinach

1 shallot

2 garlic cloves

chunk of smoked cheese (or any cheese or even none)

salt, pepper, ground nutmeg

I steamed both, sweet potato and spinach. Once the potato is soft, all you have to do is peel the skin and mash it. For spinach, wait till it’s cooler and push or wring out any liquid out of the green mass. Put the spinach into a clean cloth if it helps you to remove excess water.

Fry the finely chopped shallot and garlic on a bit of a butter, add spinach, sweet potato and spices and finally add grated cheese. Stir well and let it cool.

Last but not least: ravioli.

Take a large pot, fill with water and bring it to boil. Add lots of salt.

Ingredients:

300g flour (I used all purpose flour)

2 eggs

4 egg yolks

a pinch of salt

Sift the flour into a bowl, combine all ingredients and then knead into a smooth dough on a surface dusted with flour. Rest covered for about 30 minutes.

I didn’t have pasta machine available so I had to roll out the dough manually and it went just fine, just make sure it’s thin but doesn’t tear. If you have the machine, happy days, use it and enjoy the ease.

You can either divide the pasta into two halves, roll one part thinly out and then use a tea spoon to put the filling on the rolled out pasta. Then roll out the other half and carefully lay over the first sheet and use a wheel cutter to cut the ravioli.

Alternatively you can roll out the whole dough, cut into larger squares and put filling in the middle of each square. Then fold them to create triangles.

In both cases make sure you press the edges of the dough very firmly so the filling doesn’t leak out while cooking.

Put the ravioli into the boiling water and cook them till they’ve risen to the surface. Use a large slotted spoon to remove ravioli from water.

Put ravioli onto a bottom of a large soup plate, cover with broth and chunks of beef. Decorate with herbs if you like.

This is a delicious and filling meal with a rustic touch. If you have left-over ravioli, you can serve them with melted butter, tomato sauce or anything you like.

Bon Appetit!
