  <h2>Recipe</h2>

  I can’t guarantee complete originality of my stories. Subconsciously I’m probably taking a part of inspiration from stories, plots, movies, books or even songs I’ve heard or read in the past. It’s not easy to be original when you are asked to tell a story at a drop of a hat. I hope you will enjoy my stories anyway. Read them first before you tell them your children, some can be spooked easier than others.
